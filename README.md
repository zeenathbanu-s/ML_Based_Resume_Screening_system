# Resume Screening using Machine Learning

## 📌 What is this project?

This project helps companies automatically read and understand resumes using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It saves time by quickly sorting resumes into job categories like Data Science, HR, DevOps, etc.

## 💡 Why did I build it?

Big companies get thousands of resumes for each job. Reading all of them manually takes a lot of time and effort. This system helps them:
- Quickly find the right candidates
- Avoid hiring mistakes
- Save money and reduce work

## 🔧 How does it work?

### 🗂️ Dataset
I used a dataset with many resumes. Each resume was already labeled with a job category.

### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy (for data handling)
- Seaborn and Matplotlib (for graphs)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- TF-IDF (to convert text into numbers)
- KNN and Logistic Regression (ML models)
- Google Colab (to run the code)

### 🔍 Steps I followed
1. **Clean the text** in resumes (removed unwanted symbols)
2. **Convert job categories** into numbers
3. **Change text to numbers** using TF-IDF
4. **Train models** to learn and predict categories
5. **Check accuracy** of the models
6. **Show results** using pie charts and bar graphs

## 📊 What did I visualize?
- A **bar chart** to show how many resumes are in each category
- A **pie chart** to show the percentage of each job role

## ✅ Final Result

The system can now read resume text and predict which job category it belongs to. It is a useful tool for any company that wants to speed up their hiring process.
